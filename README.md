# Umera's Portfolio

This is my portfolio to showcase my projects. There is a little description about me and some of my skills I used to create the projects. You will also find ways to contact me on the page.

## Getting Started
made a rough hand sketch of how I wanted my website to look like. 

### HTML
I started out with my HTML code. 
1. added a doc type, set eng as a language and added characters,  linked my css, titled my website
2. broke out the sections I want into boxes 
3. first section is the header, second is the image and about me section, third is the projects, and then the skills section and then the contact section and lastly the footer
4. added div's and semantic elements and lists to make it clean and readable
5. also added class and id's to work better in css

### CSS
1. created a global tag for general look of the website 
2. added more items to the body to make the base of the website 
3. started working on all the sections one by one. 
4. I used flex boxes to better style the page 
5. lastly used the @media screen to make the page mobile responsive (not sure if it worked correctly, need more help in that)
